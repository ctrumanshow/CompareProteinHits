RNA shiny app using SQL db for the castello lab for quick proteomic comparisons

>This repository stores the server and ui r scripts needed to run an R Shiny app using SQL database. 
>The aim of this app is to access different protein datasets (through the SQL database) and produce comparisons via venn diagram plotting of common/independent proteins/genes.
>While accessible from any machine, the database is not currently active (the SQL database was set up on a now-defunct machine and I need to set it up again)
>The code is still viable.
